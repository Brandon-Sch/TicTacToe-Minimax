# TicTacToe Minimax AI

This is an AI built using the minimax algorithm that plays you in TicTacToe and is unbeatable. All games end with either the AI winning or a tie. 

You play using the keys - q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x, c set up in order of the board:  
q w e    
a s d    
z x c

## Lessons Learned

This project was my first time working with the Minimax Algorithm and recursion. While it was confusing at first, after extensive research I got it down. 

This project tought me a lot about **debugging** as for a while my AI wasn't working properly. It took me hours of trial and error along with research and help from others to finally get it working and when it worked it felt amazing!
